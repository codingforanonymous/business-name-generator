# Business Name Generator

This project is a basic yet creative tool that generates random business names by combining three words from predefined categories. 

What makes it unique is that it avoids using arrays, focusing instead on simple Math.random() logic and conditionals. It's beginner-friendly and demonstrates how even without complex data structures, you can still build fun and functional projects with just core JavaScript features.

## Features
- No arrays used
- Simple conditional logic
- Random name combinations
- Beginner-friendly code structure

## How to Use
Open the index.html file in your browser. A new business name will be generated and displayed in the console or on the page.
